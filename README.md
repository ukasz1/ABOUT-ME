<h2>Who am I</h2>
A web designer with technical and economic education.
<br />
<br />
I am interested in front-end developing - React, JS, HTML and all that goes with it. Broadning my knowledge in Javascript I find interesting and exiting. I like to know how the world around me works so I am also interested in back-end: Node, MongoDB. For last months I intensively expand my knowledge. In the future I would like to be a full-stack developer.
